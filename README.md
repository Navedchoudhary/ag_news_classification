This project performs **News Article Classification** using two approaches:
1. **Naive Bayes with TF-IDF**
2. **BERT (Transformer-based Model)**

It includes **data preprocessing, visualization, training, and evaluation** for both models.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (Stopwords removal, tokenization, lemmatization)
- **Data Visualization** (Word Cloud, Category Distribution)
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** with **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**
- **BERT-based Text Classification**
- **Model Performance Evaluation** (Accuracy, Classification Report)
- **Model Saving & Deployment Preparation**
